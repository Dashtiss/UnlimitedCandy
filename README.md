## Usage

UnlimitedCandy modifies the behavior of interactions with SCP-330 based on your configuration settings. By default, it allows players to receive an unlimited number of candies from SCP-330. You can customize the plugin's behavior by adjusting the configuration settings.

## Configuration

The configuration  allows you to control how much candy a player can get: defauls are below:

- `IsEnabled`: Set this option to `true` to enable the plugin, or `false` to disable it. Default = true

- `Debug`: Enable debugging by setting this option to `true`. Debugging can be useful for troubleshooting any issues with the plugin. Default = false

- `Max`: This option controls the maximum number of candies a player can get from SCP-330. Set it to `-1` to disable the limit (allow unlimited candies), or specify a positive integer to limit the number of candies a player can receive. Default = -1

Example configuration:
```yaml
UnlimitedCandy:
  IsEnabled: true
  Debug: false
  Max: -1 # Unlimited candies by default
```
